# YourFavoriteAnimeCharacter-Cihper
Scanner-Riverse-String-Cipher

## I worte this code after I got a similar assignment from my online course. This is for fun.

### Steps
1. The users type their favourite anime character. (If the name contains a couple words, the users have to use '_'.)
2. The users type the reason why they love that character. (The users have to use '_' instead of using white spaces to write the sentence)
3. The users type their favourite haracter's age.
4. The users get the cipher.


## What I used
Java, Mark Down
